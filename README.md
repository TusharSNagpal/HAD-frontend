With the objective of providing timely health check-ups of the patients at their home itself by taking in consideration the
internet connectivity in those areas, we have designed and developed a mobile application with offline functionality being
implemented for Health Workers who will visit patients and fill in remarks of tasks assigned by doctor, so that doctor can
take further actions of either generating more follow-ups or closing the case.
The healthcare system also includes Supervisors and Doctors, for which we have designed and developed a web
application.
